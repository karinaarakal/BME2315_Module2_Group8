    "*The dataset analyzed in this project consists of 78 graysclae histological images of bleomycin-induced fibrotic mouse lungs, each captured at different tissue depths ranging from 0-10,000 micrometers. These data were collected by administering bleomycin, a chemotherapeutic antibiotic known to cause IPF, to mice and subsequently, harvesting their lung tissue. The tissue was then sectioned and immunostained for proteins relevant to fibrosis, including desmin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and CD-31. These stained sections were then imaged using high-resolution Aperio AT2 whole-slide imaging, producing graysclae images in which white regions correspond to fibrotic regions and black regions represent healthy lung tissues.  which investigates molecular\n",
